#  Analysis and Visualization of Frequency Domain Features

The primary focus of this analysis is on interpreting the time-frequency characteristics of each channel and identifying which wavelet decomposition coefficient is most similar to the original signal.

## Features Extracted

### FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
- The FFT is used to transform the time-domain signal into the frequency domain.
- This helps in understanding the frequency components present in the EEG signals.

### Wavelet Decomposition
- Wavelet decomposition is performed using the Daubechies wavelet (`db4`) at 4 levels.
- This technique provides a time-frequency representation of the signal, which is useful for analyzing non-stationary signals like EEG.

## Visualizations

### FFT and Wavelet Coefficients
- For each class, the FFT and wavelet coefficients are plotted for the first data point.
- This helps in visualizing the frequency components and the time-frequency characteristics of the EEG signals.

### Wavelet Decomposition Coefficients
- The wavelet decomposition coefficients (approximation and detail coefficients) are plotted for each channel.
- This visualization helps in understanding the contribution of different frequency bands to the original signal.

### Spectrogram
- Spectrograms are generated for a random sample from the dataset.
- Spectrograms provide a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a signal as it varies with time.

## Interpretation

### Time-Frequency Characteristics
The time-frequency characteristics of each channel can be interpreted from the FFT and wavelet decomposition plots:

- **FFT Plots**: Show the amplitude of different frequency components.
- **Wavelet Decomposition Plots**: Show how these components vary over time.

#### Observations from the Images

##### FFT Plots
- The FFT plots indicate the dominant frequency components in each channel.
- Peaks in these plots correspond to significant frequency components.
- For example, in the plots provided, channels show varying frequency distributions, with some channels having more pronounced peaks at specific frequencies.

##### Wavelet Decomposition Plots
- The wavelet decomposition plots provide a detailed view of how the signal's frequency components change over time.
- The approximation coefficients (low-frequency components) and detail coefficients (high-frequency components) at different levels show the time-varying nature of the EEG signals.
- By comparing these plots, one can observe which frequency bands are more active at different times.

### Similarity to Original Signal
The wavelet decomposition coefficients are compared to the original signal to identify which coefficient is most similar. This is done based on visual inspection of the plots.

#### Observations from the Images
- By visually inspecting the wavelet decomposition plots, one can identify which coefficient (approximation or detail at different levels) most closely resembles the original signal.
- For instance, in the provided plots:
  - The approximation coefficients often capture the overall trend of the original signal.
  - The detail coefficients capture the high-frequency variations.

### Spectrograms
Spectrograms provide a visual representation of the frequency content of the EEG signal over time for each channel. Brighter regions in the spectrogram indicate higher power at specific frequencies. Observations include:

- Channels show variations in power across frequency bands over time.
- Consistent power in lower frequencies may indicate relaxed mental states, while abrupt changes or high-frequency power concentrations could point to seizure-like activity.

### Wavelet Decomposition Graphs
From the provided wavelet decomposition graph for each channel:

- **Approximation coefficients** are smoother and retain the most significant portion of the original signal. They capture the overall trend of the signal and are generally the most similar to the original signal.
- **Detail coefficients (Levels 1, 2, and 3)** represent finer, higher-frequency details of the signal. These coefficients add more granular information but don't fully resemble the original signal compared to the approximation.

Thus, **Approximation Coefficients** are the most similar to the original signal for each channel.
