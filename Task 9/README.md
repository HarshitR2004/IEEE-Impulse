## Methodology

### 1. Signal Denoising
A custom `MultiChannelEEGDenoiser` class was developed, featuring:
- **Wavelet Transform**: Utilized the `sym4` wavelet for effective decomposition and reconstruction.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Applied to suppress noise while preserving signal integrity.
- **Parallel Processing**: Enabled efficient batch denoising for large datasets.

**Performance**:
- Mean Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): **10.62 dB**
- Channel-wise PSNR values are available in the implementation for detailed analysis.

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Extracted **950 features per sample**, incorporating both time-domain and frequency-domain attributes.
- Features were saved as **NumPy arrays** to ensure reproducibility and facilitate downstream analysis.

### 3. Neural Network Classifier
Designed a robust neural network for classification using **PyTorch**. Key training details:
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Cross Entropy
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
