# EEG Data Synthesis and Classification

This repository contains code for generating synthetic EEG data using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) and training a classifier on the generated data. The synthetic data is evaluated for quality and used to train a classifier, which is then evaluated on real validation data.

## Introduction

This project aims to generate synthetic EEG data using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) and evaluate the quality of the generated data. The synthetic data is then used to train a classifier, which is evaluated on real validation data.

### CGAN Architecture

The CGAN consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator is responsible for generating synthetic EEG data, while the discriminator is responsible for distinguishing between real and synthetic data.

#### Generator

The generator is a conditional generator that takes a noise vector and a class label as input and generates synthetic EEG data. It includes several convolutional transpose layers to upsample the input noise vector to the desired sequence length and number of channels. The generator also includes batch normalization and ReLU activation functions to stabilize training and introduce non-linearity.

#### Discriminator

The discriminator is a conditional discriminator that takes the EEG data and a class label as input and outputs a probability that the data is real. It includes several convolutional layers to downsample the input data, followed by leaky ReLU activation functions and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The discriminator also includes batch normalization to stabilize training.

## Training the CGAN

The CGAN is trained using a binary cross-entropy loss function. The generator and discriminator are trained alternately. The discriminator is trained to minimize the loss on real data and maximize the loss on synthetic data, while the generator is trained to minimize the loss on synthetic data. The training process involves generating synthetic data, updating the discriminator and generator parameters, and calculating the loss.

## Generating Synthetic Data

Synthetic data is generated using the trained generator model. The function takes the number of samples to generate, the dimension of the noise vector, the device, and an optional class distribution as input. The generator produces synthetic EEG data based on the input noise vector and class labels.

## Evaluating Synthetic Data

The quality of the synthetic data is evaluated using several metrics, including the Wasserstein distance, mean, and standard deviation for each class. These metrics help assess how closely the synthetic data resembles the real data.

## Training the Classifier

The classifier is trained using the synthetic data generated by the CGAN. The training process involves feeding the synthetic data into the classifier, calculating the loss, and updating the classifier parameters. The classifier is evaluated on real validation data to assess its performance.

## Evaluating the Classifier

The classifier is evaluated using several metrics, including the classification report, balanced accuracy, and AUC-ROC score. These metrics help assess the performance of the classifier on the validation data.

## Results

The results of the classifier evaluation on the validation data are as follows:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 0     | 0.98      | 0.98   | 0.98     | 696     |
| 1     | 0.98      | 0.99   | 0.98     | 549     |
| 2     | 0.99      | 0.96   | 0.97     | 137     |
| 3     | 1.00      | 0.95   | 0.98     | 21      |

**Accuracy:** 0.98

**Balanced Accuracy:** 0.969552196310917

**AUC-ROC Score:** 0.9971428730067373

The classifier achieved a high balanced accuracy and AUC-ROC score, indicating that the synthetic data generated by the CGAN is of high quality and useful for training a classifier.
